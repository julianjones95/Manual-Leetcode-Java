# Manual-Leetcode-Java
This is a repo that has Java DS & A problems. 

### Why?

Although having leetcode abstract away some things helps focus on DS & A it can distract from language semantics. Things like:
 - Which libraries to include
 - What function type should you return
 - How should tests be structured
 - Java versioning and compilation/runtime


### Who is this repository for?

Not everyone will want to think about language semantics and which tests should be written. But if you do this repository may be useful for you.
